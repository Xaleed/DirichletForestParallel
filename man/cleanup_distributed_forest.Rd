cleanup_distributed_forest(distributed_forest)

Properly cleans up resources used by distributed forest.

\examples{
\donttest{
# Setup
X <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 4), 100, 4)
Y <- MCMCpack::rdirichlet(100, c(2, 3, 4))

# Build forest
df <- DirichletForest_distributed(X, Y, B = 50)

# Use the forest...
pred <- predict_distributed_forest(df, X)

# Always clean up at the end, especially on Windows
cleanup_distributed_forest(df)

# After cleanup, cluster is no longer available
# This would fail: predict_distributed_forest(df, X)
